The SocialGrid widget makes it easy to include attractive links to your various social media profiles on the web.

== Description ==

SocialGrid is a simple widget that makes it easy to add and organize links to your various profiles on the internet. It began as a simple addition to my [Tasty Theme](http://whalesalad.com/tasty), and has evolved into a next generation WordPress plugin available for anyone incorporate into their site.

SocialGrid currently supports the following services: Cargo Collective, Dribbble, Delicious, deviantART, Digg, Dopplr, Ember, Facebook, Flickr, Forrst, Google+, Last.fm, LinkedIn, MySpace, Picasa Web, Posterous, Qik, Readernaut, Reddit, RSS, StumbleUpon, Tumblr, Twitter, Technorati, Viddler, Vimeo, Virb, and YouTube!

This plugin works great with my [Tasty WordPress Theme](http://whalesalad.com/tasty)!

The icon set used in this plugin is from the very talented Rogie King of Komodo Media, [check them out](http://www.komodomedia.com/blog/2009/06/social-network-icon-pack/)!

== Installation ==

* Upload the `socialgrid` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory, and enable it in the plugins area of your WordPress admin.
* In the **Widgets** area of your site, drag the SocialGrid widget into your sidebar and the desired location.
* In the **Appearance** area of your site, click on **SocialGrid Options** and you'll be greeted with the page to configure your SocialGrid.

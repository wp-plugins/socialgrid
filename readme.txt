The SocialGrid widget makes it easy to include attractive links to your various social media profiles on the web.

== Description ==

SocialGrid is a simple widget that makes it easy to add and organize links to your various profiles on the internet. It began as a simple addition to my [Tasty Theme](http://whalesalad.com/tasty), and has evolved into a next generation WordPress plugin available for anyone incorporate into their site.

SocialGrid currently supports the following services: Brightkite, Delicious, deviantART, Digg, Dopplr, Ember, Facebook, Flickr, Friendfeed, Google Profile, Last.fm, LinkedIn, MySpace, Picasa Web, Posterous, Qik, Readernaut, Reddit, RSS, StumbleUpon, Tumblr, Twitter, Viddler, Vimeo, Virb, and YouTube!

The icon set used in this plugin is from the very talented Rogie King of Komodo Media, [check them out](http://www.komodomedia.com/blog/2009/06/social-network-icon-pack/)!

== Installation ==

* Upload the `socialgrid` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory, and enable it in the plugins area of your WordPress admin.
* In the **Widgets** area of your site, drag the SocialGrid widget into your sidebar and the desired location.
* In the **Appearance** area of your site, click on **SocialGrid Options** and you'll be greeted with the page to configure your SocialGrid.
